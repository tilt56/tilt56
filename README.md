@tilt56 is me.

I've been learning various coding langauges *very* slowly, on and off, over the past 6 years.
Video games are a strong interest for me, both making them and playing them.
So far none of my games have been properly released yet, but I've been working on an online multiplayer top down shooter. I enojoy making all the art assets. Progress has been slow, but I enjoy the process. The engine that I mostly use is GameMaker Studio 2, but I'm sure I can learn others if I need to. I like online networking on it, thought there are probably better options that I just haven't see much of.
